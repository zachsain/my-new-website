        <h2>List of my life's passions: </h2>

        <h3> MUSIC </h3>
        

            <img class= "music" src="https://scontent-hou1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/35833813_10156665391098714_9025362280593752064_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=09cbfe&_nc_ohc=kmpQXAFTPNYAX8OdsRE&tn=vJfB8BLLldpttjmJ&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.xx&oh=9fff7be3bd25e34370dcde1b1e4e7cdf&oe=6162E4AE" alt="Piano man">

            <p class="pcenter"> My first passion in life was music. Playing instruments from a very young age, I grew a deep love for the study of harmony and melody. I started off playing drums and trombone, then transitioned to guitar, then bass, and then keyboard. But my favorite part about creating music was song writing. After graduating highschool I studied Jazz Guitar at University of Northern Colorado, then Jazz Piano at Loyola University New Orleans. 
            After dropping out to play professionally a few years, I would go back to finish my degree at a small conservatory in Los Angeles called Los Angeles College of Music, where I studied Audio Engineering and Music Production.</p>

        <h3> TECHNOLOGY</h3>

            <p class="pcenter"> During my time between playing music professionally and going back to school to finish my degree I developed a big passion for technology and tech-startups. I loved the idea that building and being involved in innovate technology has the power to impact society in a very profound way. 
                It was the first time I found something I loved just as much as music. I found that it required creativity and problem solving skills the same way that writing a great song would. I also loved the people that I worked with. It's been the only job I had where I didn't feel like I was actually going to work.  </p>
